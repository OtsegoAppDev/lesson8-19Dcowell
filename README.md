Getting Started with GUIs

###### Complete the two projects from Raspberrypi.org and then complete the discussion questions on the readme

### Discussion Questions
1) Why might a programmer choose a group of checkboxes over a buttongroup widget?  Compare and Contrast.
2) When a user clicks the book seats button, does your program do anything to the data that was entered into the form?  How do you know?
3) Why is it useful to use a combo widget rather than a textbox widget to enter the movie name?
4) What do you think the program should do with the information when the user clicks the book seats button?  Explain in detail.
5) Should the user always get a dialog box at the end confirming that the seats have been booked?  Why/why not?
